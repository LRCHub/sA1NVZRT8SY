Get back (Get back, get back...)
Get back (Get back, get back...)

The warm air is flowing over your skin
The wind is whispering secret things
Feel the silence deep inside
Imagine a sunset embracing the night
Diving deep into your mind, you can let your soul unwind (unwind...)
There's no fear to keep you down
Trust yourself with your own sound

Get back to serenity
Come on strong, set your spirit free
Get back to serenity
Tune yourself in to a true reality
(Tune yourself in to a true reality...)

Where do you come from, where do you go
Is there a reason that keeps you in flow
Walking on water, lighter than air
Into the ocean, now you are there
Now you are there
Peace of mind is all around
Rising up when the sun goes down (sun goes down...)
Into the ocean of your bliss
Into the light where your home is
Where your home is

Get back to serenity
Come on strong, set your spirit free
Get back to serenity
Tune yourself in to a true reality
