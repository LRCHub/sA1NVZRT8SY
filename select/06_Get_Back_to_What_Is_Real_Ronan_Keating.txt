There was a day when you were mine
I told you that I needed time
To see the world and go be free
To know if we were meant to be

Its my crime crime crime
We lost time time time
Are you still mine mine mine
Now that I see the light

So baby whats the deal deal
Please tell me what you feel feel
Are we too hurt to heal heal
Lets get back to what is real real yeah

The time I lived with someone else
It was not a home it was just a house
And though you were hurt I was running free
You never turned your back on me

Its my crime crime crime
And I'll do time, this hard time

Till you're mine mine mine
I pray you see the light

So baby whats the deal deal
Please tell me what you feel feel
Are we too hurt to heal heal
Lets get back to what is real real yeah

'Coz girl your love defines me
And then your life reminds me
That there's no place to find me
If I'm not with you yeah

So baby whats the deal deal
Please tell me what you feel feel
Are we too hurt to heal heal
Lets get back to what is real real yeah

'Coz when you started crying crying yeah
Inside I felt like dying baby for you
You're not to hurt to heal heal
Lets get back to what is real real yeah
